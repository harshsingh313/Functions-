        "\n",
        "Ans The difference between function and method are:-\n",
        "Function:- A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task and is defined using the def keyword. Functions exist independently, meaning they can be called anywhere in the program without being tied to an object or class. They accept arguments, execute logic, and return a value if needed. For example, a simple function that adds two numbers can be written as def add(a, b): return a + b, which allows the function to be invoked with different inputs to produce results. Functions promote modularity and reduce code repetition, making programs more readable and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method:- A method, on the other hand, is a function that is defined within a class and is associated with an instance or the class itself. Instance methods require self as the first parameter, allowing them to access and modify object attributes, while class methods use cls to interact with class-level properties. Methods are called using dot notation on an object, such as object.method(), making them essential for encapsulation and object-oriented programming. For example, in a Person class, a method like def greet(self): return f\"Hello, {self.name}!\" allows each instance to have its own behavior, making methods a crucial part of structuring and organizing code within classes."

        "Ans: function parameters and arguments are key components that allow functions to work flexibly with different inputs. A parameter is a variable listed inside the parentheses in a function definition, acting as a placeholder for values that will be passed when the function is called. An argument is the actual value supplied to the function when it is invoked. Python allows different types of arguments, including positional arguments, keyword arguments, default arguments, and variable-length arguments, each serving a specific purpose in function execution.\n",
        "For example:-  in the function def greet(name): return f\"Hello, {name}!\", name is a parameter, and when we call greet(\"Alice\"), \"Alice\" is the argument. Parameters enable functions to be adaptable and reusable, making code more efficient and structured."
